### Summary
*The summary is a short description of the project. It can be the same as the summary in the RFXs.*
*Example: This job consists of teaching 125 live training courses to Tibetans who contribute to the life-cylcle of Tibetan literature.*

### Indicators
*Indicators are used to measure progress towards specific goals or objectives. They should have a clear unit of measurement and a target that specifies the quantity, quality, and timing of expected results.*
*Example: Achieving a 25% increase in knowledge in participants (who must be geolocated in China) after completing the course.*

### Means of verification
*Means of verification explain how we will collect the necessary information to check whether the goals stated in the indicators section are reached.*
*Example: To measure how much participants have learned, we will give them pre- and post-course questionnaires. The questions on these questionnaires will not be limited to yes/no or multiple choice options.*

### Risks / Assumptions
*Risks / Assumptions are beliefs about things that could impact the project's success, but we don't have control over, such as changes in prices, weather, or government policies*
*Example: There won't be any more Covid lockdowns and the Chinese government will allow us to conduct these training sessions.*
